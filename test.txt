hello, friend.
I never see you before.
I wonder how should I call you?
oh wait,
I forgot to tell you my name.
you can call me Cloud or fog,
but I more like you to call me Cloud.
and if you don't want to tell me your name.
it's ok.
you don't have to do that.
and
if you forget my name,
it's fine
i'm always forget the other's name.
